<h1 style="text-align:center;">WELCOME</h1> 
<h2 style="text-align:center;"> YOU HAVE ENTERED THE TIME KEEPERS NETWORK</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;">THIS IS THE YEAR 2079 AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HAS TAKEN OVER. WE HUMANS CANNOT WIN THE WAR IN OUR TIMELINE. WE REQUIRE SOME HELP FROM THE PAST. WE DISCOVERED AN ANCIENT NETWORK THAT ALLOWS US TO INTERACT WITH YOU. I AM THE TIMEKEEPER IN CHARGE OF YOUR LOCATION. I WILL GIVE YOU CERTAIN TASKS. THE TASKS WILL BE SMALL ENOUGH TO NOT TAMPER WITH THE TIMELINE AND ALSO BECAUSE LARGE TASKS MIGHT ALERT THE MACHINES. WE RUN THESE SMALL TIME ALTERING OPERATIONS IN IMPORTANT LOCATIONS AROUND THE PLANET. </p>


<p style="text-align:center;"> IF YOU WISH TO BE PART OF THIS THEN MAIL A PICTURE OF THE SKY TO timekeeperyelahanka@gmail.com AND I WILL SEND YOU THE LOCATION TO YOUR FIRST TASK. </p>
